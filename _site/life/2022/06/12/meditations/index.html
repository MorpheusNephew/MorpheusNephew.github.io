<meta name="description" content="It’s been over 14,083,200 seconds since my last post. What’s changed since “YOLO Maybe?” Quite a bit and also not much. What’s the same? Well, I’m still playing chess on a board without any opposing pieces, except I see opposing pieces there. They are representations of many things ranging from ways that I hinder or sabotage myself, opinions from others whom I care about in regards to potential judgment, and fears of who I’ll hurt by making myself happy. I still have the hunger/passion for travel even though I am aware of what that might do to all forms of relationships, at least at this time. (intermission it’s 12 AM here and gotta do this Wordle)">

<p>Where was I? Oh yeah, the things that are the same. Still giving my best in all of the things from getting better at my craft as an engineer, working on my dancing (salsa, bachata, etc…), y practicando mi espanol. I think that’s where <em>the same</em> ends. So what’s new? Well, I’m no longer living in Ft Lauderdale even though I do miss it for a multitude of reasons. I’m back on the road or air depending on the slang you want to use. Writing this in Tulum as I try to process some things. I’ve found an appreciation for the C word (Consistency) for which without nothing is really possible. New property management, new (hopefully) non shitty tenants. Losing old non-productive habits, while forming new productive ones.</p>

<p>The more I live life, the more lessons I learn, and the more lessons I learn the more those opposing chess pieces continue to fade. I find myself in that place like the single lily pad in a pond starting its takeover of that pond. The eventual explosion of growth cannot yet be seen, but it is inevitable.</p>
