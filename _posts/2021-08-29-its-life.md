All these dreams I have, that I'm super afraid to obtain. Once the money and success comes I know I'm not going be the same. Just from the start of writing this I'm already feeling different. Get you a library card for real, I'll tell anyone who will listen. Listen, you never know in life what you'll end up missing. I've lived some many lifetimes in 9 months is this Christmas?!? So many learnable moments, learned how to express myself and smell the roses. Life's too short, word to C-Mac and SQL Andy for the notice. So the past 9 months, not symbolic of anything that's just coincidence, that almost trap situation was many moons ago. What have I learned in that span of time? That I'm [lucky](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-afghanistan-ovarian-lottery-luck-inequality-higher-taxes-rich-2021-8) enough and shouldn't complain too much. Fortunate enough that I seek [knowledge](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-earned-income-exclusion#:~:text=Foreign%2Dearned%20income%3A%20Foreign%2D,personal%20services%20rendered%20by%20you.&text=The%20excluded%20amount%20will%20reduce,reduce%20your%20self%2Demployment%20tax.) and try to find ways that I can play this game better. My sole purpose for being observant is to make her wetter. Haha, damn that was uncomfortable. I think about the future and what I want from it. Everyone seeks what they want, but most don't know what they can give. The knowledge I've acquired got me turning 20 grand into 40. [MC2](https://www.instagram.com/mc2transport/) is a conduit, but there's more for [me](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/). For those that scoff about me not being a millionaire yet, you gotta start somewhere, going from [zero to one](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296). Said so many words, but said nothing at all. I'm just waiting on spring time to come fall. I love ya'll, real shit man I love ya'll. Even the folks I can't stand to be around. I appreciate your existence because if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't do what I could to not be around you. If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around it makes a sound too. Haven't said much in a minute I wish I could condense things and share more. Almost like a condensed version of [where for](https://wherefor.com/). I'm about to do something real different. In this world of the digital age where we're less connected than ever. () <- here is where I thought about sharing my number. Let's talk about all things philosophy and figure how to be more lucky. Change the world forever from seeds planted.
