The year is 2020 part 2 and it's been a little over two years since my [_Captain's Log: First Entry_]({% post_url 2019-03-28-captains-log-first-entry %}) and a lot has happened/changed while things have also remained the same. It's been a while since my latest entry, much is different even since I've encountered my 34th revolution around our nearest star. In the year 2020 part 1 my ship was "stranded" in the beautiful land of Colombia due to a virus that has caused the human inhabitants of this planet (Earth) to pause on a global scale. Majority of the time was spent in the land of the Eternal Spring (Medellin) where the precautions for this virus resulted in roughly 6 months of lockdowns to varying degrees of severity. Fast forward to the time of this writing the year is 2020 part 2 or as the inhabitants here say year 2021 the 25th of April. Parts of the world appear to be resuming in a new normal as a trinity of vaccinations are being provided to help protect the humans from this virus. As I try to understand the norms and customs to "fit" into this society (not seriously) I've come to realize that not much of it actually interests me. This may be the cause of the draining of my ship's energy supplies. In an attempt to restore those energy supplies while I try to decipher what's next on this journey, I've picked up a game of my yesteryears... Golf. I enjoy the difficulty in it, the game within the game, competing against yourself.

Within this time frame I left the Federation of PowerDMS and I've secured a new working arrangement to earn currency of the land of the United States. The Federation of Life Genomics has been a breath of fresh air in a room filled with staleness. I've been informed that I have entered the camp of the proven, but I don't believe that the work of proving yourself is ever done so I'll continue to prove myself, I do welcome the sentiments. To supplement this currency I've grown increasingly interested in this thing called investing. Putting portions of your currency in places where you will either acquire additional currency, knowledge, experiences, etc... The goal, for me at least, is to not spend much time to acquire additional currency. Spend minimal time + put money somewhere + ??? = profit, such a great equation. As I've come to understand the meaning of investing it appears I've been doing this for quite some time and have recently entered a partnership with [MC2 Transport](https://www.instagram.com/mc2transport/) to acquire more of this currency, again with minimal time from myself. If I continue to make these investments I should be able to free up more time for myself. Ah, did I stumble upon my ships energy supply being depleted? With said free time I could attempt to enjoy activities that require time to master from language learning to playing the piano and more. Until next time continue to live fully, continue making yourself happy, continue to rest so that you can exert the amount of energy needed to make magic happen.
