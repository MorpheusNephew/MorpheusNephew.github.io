We are currently living in strange times. The coronavirus is running ramped throughout the world, toilet paper is a major commodity in the United States from what I hear, and I'm hanging out in Medellin a little stressed about nothing to do with the current pandemic. It's not that I don't worry about the potential of getting sick from the coronavirus, but I think my superman attitude about pretty much everything has me covered to some degree. That's if the assumption that mind over matter is really a thing and if the way we're using our prana or life force is working for us and not against. That's really not the focus of this post though, maybe another time.

With the amount of soul searching that appears to be happening at this time. Finally having no choice but to sit with your thoughts, no way to truly escape from them, I haven't been doing much of that. It's not like that I don't take time to analyze my thoughts and to figure out what it is that I want out of life, but I do that a few times a month and definitely on my birthday. That's when I do the most reflection on the previous year, seeing how far I've come, and where I want to head in the future.

So, I don't know if it's because I've been stuck in my apartment since the middle of March or what, but lately I've been noticing some activity that's been quite concerning and a little stressful. Before I continue I think it's best to define what I mean by zombie. I don't mean the walking dead kind or the crazy ones from I Am Legend. My term of zombie for this post is one that is not present or not resourceful.

Honestly, the more I think about it, I'm really just using that term zombie as not resourceful. Reality is interesting, especially now, sometimes we need to escape to give our brains a break from all of the information that's around, trying to filter out what's real and what's fake 24/7 is a job I don't think anyone can really handle and remain sane. So, back to the zombies, pretty much any movie in regards to zombies they tend to feed on the living. Being a fan of parables and allegories I tend to look at this as
