Is this an impasse? Am I just burnt out? This casamigos anejo double and these dozen oysters are much needed. So what's new? I've been at my current job for just over a year now. My review went as I expected it to go because I know the type of work I put in (humble brag). I've been given a golden parachute that I can choose whatever career path I want. Do I want to be a manager? Absolutely not. Do I want to accept the title and responsibilities of a principal engineer where, at this company that means, I oversee all things related technology wise for a product. I'll put a pin in that. Or continue the journey in my senior role where I have the freedom to knockout work and continue my travel life uninterrupted? I like the way that sounds. Plus not being salary capped by title is also nice.

So things are mostly good on the job front except for feeling burnt out. Here comes the tangent that I'll run with. Work is cool, it really is, but I've been working on a side project. Hopefully I make the right decisions in regards to this project so that I don't really have to work in the traditional sense. I guess like most people I'm kind of over it. Not over working in general because I do find an added sense of purpose, but I'd rather be working on things I want to see come to life. Live the life of the learner. Travel to foreign lands, interacting with the people talking about philosophy and whatever worthwhile topics that may arise. Spending time learning and speaking multiple languages to laugh about how we are more alike than different. Cheers to the many worlds we're all attempting to create for ourselves.

This is actually the end of my writing, but there's a dude here at the bar that's super obnoxious and for some reason he keeps trying to get my attention, as if me writing in my notepad isn't a sign to stfu and let me continue, to talk about dumb shit. I say dumb based on the other conversations he's having with the other patrons. By this time I've already murked my dozen oysters and am now on my second double of casamigos anejo. Another tangent, who supplies this place with their alcohol because I literally can't find anejo anywhere. Ok, I'm done for real now.

"Aw baby, stop debating, I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated"
