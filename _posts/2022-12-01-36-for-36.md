How good and how pleasant it is to grow old with a young soul. People focused on aging themselves too quickly that's why I'm gung ho about traveling and experiencing life while I still have time. This isn't an open letter about something devastating where my life flashed before my eyes. Just a recurring realization that nothing is promised. We're here for a blink of an eye, the moment is here, and then it's gone. [Two years ago today](/life/2020/12/01/34/) my time living in Colombia due to COVID was coming to an end. I just remembered how uncertain everything was at the time of writing. Little did I know that I would immediately come back to the States and have a bout with COVID. Nor did I know that I would decide to spend 13 months living in Ft Lauderdale and later decide let me get back to traveling pretty much most of 2022. I had no idea that any of the things that occurred would occur, but what I did know was that I would/could never get time back and that I can't/shouldn't wait for others to aid in my happiness or the fulfilling life I want to live. I mean, it's **my happiness**, what sense would it make to give someone else the power over something so important to me. What's in store for the next two years? Well I have a pretty loose plan. In the end of 2022 and most of 2023 I will travel to Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, as well as a the continent of Africa (haven't figured out the countries yet). I'll continue to be a non-drifter as mentioned in my other posts and continuing to enjoy life.

It's funny how today has been super cool and I have this seemingly intrinsic motivation to write something because... well I haven't written in a while. Then I start and I'm like... eh... yeah I don't know if I care that much to continue. I guess it's an evolution type of deal where I begin to question, what is this for? Who is this for? Maybe when I figure that out I'll write a post about it or not. Anyway, time to hit up club bed so I can get in the gym in the morning. Trying to focus on aging gracefully and I've found a new love, if you will, for the gym. I've been more consistent than I've ever been, probably because how much shit I was talking about people doing wordle daily, but not being able to create a new habit. Most of the time if you see me post something like that chances are I'm talking ot myself. Anyway, stay you, live life, and do weird things.

Random shout out to Rafa for the shirt when his dog put her pretty little paws on my white shirt. That was a cool day in Guatape jumping off of bridges (yup, totally did it) and kicking it with cool people #RemoteYear
