Off in the corner contemplating my way in as it drizzles. Beautiful life ahead of me, but in this moment it doesn't feel as such. Everyday as I work towards moving myself from where I am to where I'll ultimately end up takes quite a bit of time, effort, and energy, some of which I feel as though I have been misusing. Part of it is me thinking of futures that wouldn't exist, the other part is the environment. One influences the other and I've been contemplating making a change to the latter which could potentially render the former non-existent.

Uncertainty can be a great motivator to make things happen, I know this personally really well. Before anything changes one must first conjure (hocus pocus vibes) what about their current state should be changed and what's the alternative that should take its place. This is the beautiful thing about choice. If you feel your current state of being has reached its expiration or you just don't like it then you can choose to change it. Sure, some changes can be more immediate than others, but even for less immediate changes there are still actions that can be taken to get you moving in the direction that you're looking for.

Ok... here are just a few things I want to say that I'm grateful for:

- Congrats again big sis (Kisha) on getting your MBA and being able to get some of your time back
- Thank you Ken for hitting me up about playing golf, it was a cool time and ended up meeting "No IG" Chase who jumped in with us
- I'm grateful for the start of Weekly Check Wednesday sponsored by MC2 Transport and my original investment
- Thank you to the folks that can deal with my type of "weird"
- I'm grateful for the life I've been able to curate
- I'm super thankful for being able to be an observer of my own thoughts/feelings to be able to better process them (super underrated)
- I'm grateful for being self-aware (also super underrated)
- I'm thankful that I'll be able to get back to these travels, maybe sooner than later depending on a few things

- I think lastly what I'm grateful for is that with all of the stimuli coming from everywhere I can be drastic and shut everything down for as long as I need to to "recenter."

Well that's all I have for today cool cats and kittens, stay classy out there.
